# AWS-EKS

Cluster.dev uses [stack templates](https://docs.cluster.dev/stack-templates-overview/) to generate users' projects in a desired cloud. AWS-EKS is a stack template that creates and provisions Kubernetes clusters in AWS cloud by means of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

On this page you will find guidance on how to create an EKS cluster on AWS using one of the Cluster.dev prepared samples â€“ the [AWS-EKS](https://github.com/shalb/cdev-aws-eks) stack template. Running the example code will have the following resources created:

* EKS cluster with addons:

    * cert-manager

    * ingress-nginx

    * external-dns

    * argocd

* AWS IAM roles for EKS IRSA cert-manager and external-dns

* *(optional, if you use cluster.dev domain)* Route53 zone **<cluster-name>.cluster.dev**

* *(optional, if vpc_id is not set)* VPC for EKS cluster

## Prerequisites

1. Terraform version 1.4+

2. AWS account

3. [AWS CLI](#install-aws-client) installed

4. kubectl installed

5. [Cluster.dev client installed](https://docs.cluster.dev/get-started-install/)

### Authentication

Cluster.dev requires cloud credentials to manage and provision resources. You can configure access to AWS in two ways:

!!! Info
    Please note that you have to use IAM user with granted administrative permissions.

* **Environment variables**: provide your credentials via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, the environment variables that represent your AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Key. You can also use the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` or `AWS_REGION` environment variable to set region, if needed. Example usage:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="MYACCESSKEY"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="MYSECRETKEY"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-central-1"
    ```

* **Shared Credentials File (recommended)**: set up an [AWS configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to specify your credentials.

    Credentials file `~/.aws/credentials` example:

    ```bash
    [cluster-dev]
    aws_access_key_id = MYACCESSKEY
    aws_secret_access_key = MYSECRETKEY
    ```

    Config: `~/.aws/config` example:

    ```bash
    [profile cluster-dev]
    region = eu-central-1
    ```

    Then export `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.

    ```bash
    export AWS_PROFILE=cluster-dev
    ```

### Install AWS client

If you don't have the AWS CLI installed, refer to AWS CLI [official installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html), or use commands from the example:

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws s3 ls
```

### Create S3 bucket

Cluster.dev uses S3 bucket for storing states. Create the bucket with the command:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://cdev-states
```

### DNS Zone

In AWS-EKS stack template example you need to define a Route 53 hosted zone. Options:

1. You already have a Route 53 hosted zone.

2. Create a new hosted zone using a [Route 53 documentation example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/route53/create-hosted-zone.html#examples).

3. Use "cluster.dev" domain for zone delegation.

## Create project

1. Configure [access to AWS](#authentication) and export required variables.

2. Create locally a project directory, cd into it and execute the command:

    ```bash
      cdev project create https://github.com/shalb/cdev-aws-eks
    ```
    This will create a new empty project.

3. Edit variables in the example's files, if necessary:

    * `project.yaml` - main project config. Sets common global variables for current project such as organization, region, state bucket name etc. See [project configuration docs](https://docs.cluster.dev/structure-project/).

    * `backend.yaml` - configures backend for Cluster.dev states (including Terraform states). Uses variables from `project.yaml`. See [backend docs](https://docs.cluster.dev/structure-backend/).

    * `stack.yaml` - describes stack configuration. See [stack docs](https://docs.cluster.dev/structure-stack/).

4. Run `cdev plan` to build the project. In the output you will see an infrastructure that is going to be created after running `cdev apply`.

    !!! note
        Prior to running `cdev apply` make sure to look through the `stack.yaml` file and replace the commented fields with real values. In case you would like to use existing VPC and subnets, uncomment preset options and set correct VPC ID and subnets' IDs. If you leave them as is, Cluster.dev will have VPC and subnets created for you.

5. Run `cdev apply`

    !!! tip
        We highly recommend to run `cdev apply` in a debug mode so that you could see the Cluster.dev logging in the output: `cdev apply -l debug`

6. After `cdev apply` is successfully executed, in the output you will see the ArgoCD URL of your cluster. Sign in to the console to check whether ArgoCD is up and running and the stack template has been deployed correctly. To sign in, use the "admin" login and the bcrypted password that you have generated for the `stack.yaml`.

7. Displayed in the output will be also a command on how to get kubeconfig and connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

8. Destroy the cluster and all created resources with the command `cdev destroy`
