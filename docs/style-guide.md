# Style guide

For better experience, we recommend use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - we have list of recommended extensions for prevent many common errors, improve code and save time.

We use [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). It fix basic mistakes on every file saving.

And please install [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install) and all it dependencies. It check all changed files when you run `git commit` on more complex problems and try fix it for you.

## Bash

Firstly, [install shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing) for property work vscode-shellcheck extension

We use [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).

## Terraform

We use [Terraform Best Practices.com](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/code-styling) code style and conceptions.

### Autogenerated Documentation

For successful module documentation initialization, you need create `README.md` with:

```bash
<!-- BEGINNING OF PRE-COMMIT-TERRAFORM DOCS HOOK -->

<!-- END OF PRE-COMMIT-TERRAFORM DOCS HOOK -->
```

It needs for [terraform-docs](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#notes-about-terraform_docs-hooks) hooks. All thing inside will be rewrite's by hook on every `.tf` file change.

Then run `pre-commit run --all-files` or make some changes in any `.tf` file in the same dir (for ex. `variable "name" {` -> `variable "name"{`).
